# My LMS React Native App

This is a React Native application built with Expo, designed to provide [brief description of your app's purpose, e.g., a social media app, a todo list app, etc.]. This README guides you through setting up and running the app locally, along with sample credentials for testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher): Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **Expo CLI**: Install globally using npm.
- **Expo Go**: Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device from the App Store or Google Play.
- A code editor like **Visual Studio Code**.
- A stable internet connection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Expo CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables** (if applicable):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add any required environment variables, such as API keys or backend URLs. Example:
     ```
     API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
     ```

## Running the App

1. **Start the Expo development server**:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will start the Metro Bundler and display a QR code in the terminal or browser.

2. **Run on a mobile device**:

   - Open the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device.
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser.
   - The app will load automatically on your device.

3. **Run on an emulator/simulator**:

   - For Android:
     - Ensure you have Android Studio and an emulator set up.
     - Press `a` in the terminal after running `npx expo start` to open the app in the Android emulator.
   - For iOS:
     - Ensure you have Xcode and an iOS simulator set up (macOS only).
     - Press `i` in the terminal to open the app in the iOS simulator.

4. **Access the app in a browser** (if supported):
   - If your app supports web, press `w` in the terminal to open it in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

- **Metro Bundler not starting**:

  - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
  - Clear the npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`.
  - Restart the server: `npx expo start --clear`.

- **QR code not scanning**:

  - Ensure your device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
  - Try opening the Expo Go app and manually entering the URL shown in the terminal.

- **App not loading**:
  - Check for errors in the terminal or Expo Go app.
  - Verify that your backend API (if any) is running and accessible.
